This file is for the SkyIslandType. This data object is for creating island types 
for the SkyIslandGeneratorV2. These can be created in a dimension file using 'new 
SkyIslandType(biomeID)', with the biome id being the biome you want the island to 
be, or 'new SkyIslandType()' to default to the void biome.



generateStrongholds:
    Arguments:
        int
    Usage:
        chance
    Notes:
        Sets the 1/chance for strongholds to generate for the island type. These are centered on the island, and only generate the end portal room.

generateMineshafts:
    Arguments:
        int
    Usage:
        chance
    Notes:
        Sets the 1/chance for mineshafts to generate for the island type. These are centered on the island, and size limited.

setFluidPercentage:
    Arguments:
        double
    Usage:
        percentage
    Notes:
        Defaults to 0.5. Higher values increase lake size, lower values decrease.

disableDecorations:
    Notes:
        Disables decorations for the island type.

disableBiomeBlockReplacement:
    Notes:
        Disables biome block replacement for the island type.

generateVillages:
    Arguments:
        int
    Usage:
        chance
    Notes:
        Sets the 1/chance for villages to generate for the island type. These are centered on the island, and size limited to avoid floating buildings.

disableAnimals:
    Notes:
        Disables initial animal spawning for the island type.

setBlockInRange:
    Arguments:
        ItemBlockData, MinMaxBounds
    Usage:
        block, bounds
    Notes:
        Sets a block to be used for generation within a range of distance from the center of the island type. 0.0 being the center of the island, 1.0 being the outermost possible blocks.

setFluidBlock:
    Arguments:
        ItemBlockData
    Usage:
        block
    Notes:
        Sets the fluid block for the lakes on the islands to generate.

setMainBlock:
    Arguments:
        ItemBlockData
    Usage:
        block
    Notes:
        Sets the main block for the island type to be made of.

disableFluid:
    Notes:
        Disables lake generation for the island type.

setBiome:
    Arguments:
        Non_Null_Biome_ID
    Usage:
        biome id
    Notes:
        Sets the biome to be used for the island type.

addGenerator:
    Arguments:
        IGenerator
    Usage:
        generator
    Notes:
        Adds the provided generator. This generator will only generate in chunks containing islands generated with this type.
