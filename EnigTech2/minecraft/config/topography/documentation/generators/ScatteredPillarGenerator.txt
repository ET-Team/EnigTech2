This file is for the ScatteredPillarGenerator. This generator generates scattered 
clusters of block pillars per chunk. Similar to how sugarcane is generated.



Constructor:
    Arguments:
        ItemBlockData, int, int, int, int
    Argument Usage:
        block to generate, min height, max height, clusters per chunk, blocks per cluster
    Notes:
        This constructs a ScatteredPillarGenerator.

addRequiredAdjacentBlock:
    Arguments:
        ItemBlockData
    Usage:
        required block
    Notes:
        Adds a block the generator must have adjacent to the block below it to generate. Mostly for generating things next to water or lava.

setHeight:
    Arguments:
        int, int
    Usage:
        min height, max height
    Notes:
        Sets the min and max heights this generator can generate at. Default is 4 and 250.

addRequiredBlock:
    Arguments:
        ItemBlockData
    Usage:
        required block
    Notes:
        Adds a block the generator is allowed to generate pillars on top of.
