This file is for the OverworldGenerator. This generator generates a slightly more 
configurable version of the vanilla overworld, handling the generation of base terrain/water 
blocks and biome block replacement. This generator makes use of multithreaded noise 
generators to improve chunk generation speeds. Unfortunately, using these noise generators 
means the terrain will be slightly different to vanilla. Created using 'new OverworldGenerator()'.



Constructor:
    Notes:
        This constructs an OverworldGenerator.

setGeneratorString:
    Arguments:
        String

        generator string
    Notes:
        Sets the vanilla generator settings string for the generator.

disableBiomeBlockReplacement:
    Notes:
        Disables the generators biome block replacement.

setSeaLevel:
    Arguments:
        int
    Usage:
        sea level
    Notes:
        Sets the sea level for the generator.

setOceanBlock:
    Arguments:
        ItemBlockData
    Usage:
        block
    Notes:
        Sets the ocean block to be used for the generator.

amplify:
    Notes:
        Sets the generator to generate amplified terrain, as per the vanilla amplified WorldType.

setTerrainBlock:
    Arguments:
        ItemBlockData
    Usage:
        block
    Notes:
        Sets the terrain block to be used for the generator.
