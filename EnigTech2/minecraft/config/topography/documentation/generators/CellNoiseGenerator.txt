This file is for the CellNoiseGenerator. This generator generates tendrils of blocks 
using cell noise skewed with simplex noise. This generator is multithreaded.



Constructor:
    Notes:
        This constructs a CellNoiseGenerator that generates air blocks.

Constructor:
    Arguments:
        ItemBlockData
    Argument Usage:
        block to generate
    Notes:
        This constructs a CellNoiseGenerator.

openTop:
    Notes:
        Sets the generator to scale noise in such a way that tendrils will taper off towards the top of the dimension. This is set by default.

setCutoff:
    Arguments:
        double
    Usage:
        cutoff
    Notes:
        Sets the noise cutoff for blocks to be placed. Higher values = more blocks. Default is -0.15.

closeTop:
    Notes:
        Sets the generator to scale noise in such a way that a roof will be generated at the top of the dimension.

setCellFrequency:
    Arguments:
        float
    Usage:
        frequency
    Notes:
        Sets the frequency for the cell noise used for the generator. Higher values = more frequent changes. Default is 0.005.
