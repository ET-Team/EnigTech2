This layer is meant to be a combined/improved version of the edge and mushroom island 
layers. The idea is you set a biome or list of biomes, a list of biomes to look for 
around it, a required count of those biomes, a replacement biome and optionally a 
random chance. If the biome is found, touching >= count biomes from the list to look 
for, then it is replaced with the replacement biome. If using a chance, this has 
a 1/chance chance of happening.



Constructor:
    Arguments:
        long, GenLayer
    Argument Usage:
        base layer seed, parent layer
    Notes:
        Constructs the layer with its base seed and parent layer.

addData:
    Arguments:
        Non_Null_Biome_ID_Array, Biome_ID_Array, Biome_ID_Array, int, Non_Null_Biome_ID
    Usage:
        biome IDs, whitelist, blacklist, required count, replacement biome ID
    Notes:
        Sets the biomes to check neighbors for, the whitelist/blacklist, the required count of acceptable neighbors and the replacement biome. If there are at least requiredCount number of neighbors nearby that are in the whitelist/not in the blacklist, the biome is replaced with the replacement biome.

addData:
    Arguments:
        Non_Null_Biome_ID_Array, Biome_ID_Array, Biome_ID_Array, int, Non_Null_Biome_ID, int
    Usage:
        biome IDs, whitelist, blacklist, required count, replacement biome ID, chance
    Notes:
        Sets the biomes to check neighbors for, the whitelist/blacklist, the required count of acceptable neighbors, the replacement biome and a random chance. If there are at least requiredCount number of neighbors nearby that are in the whitelist/not in the blacklist, there is a 1/chance chance for the biome to be replaced with the replacement biome.

addData:
    Arguments:
        Non_Null_Biome_ID_Array, int, Non_Null_Biome_ID, int
    Usage:
        biome IDs, required count, replacement biome ID, chance
    Notes:
        Sets the biomes to check neighbors for, the required count of acceptable neighbors, the replacement biome ID and a random chance. Chance for it to happen is 1/chance.

addData:
    Arguments:
        Non_Null_Biome_ID_Array, int, Non_Null_Biome_ID
    Usage:
        biome IDs, required count, replacement biome ID
    Notes:
        Sets biomes to check neighbors for, the required count of acceptable neighbors and the replacement biome ID.
