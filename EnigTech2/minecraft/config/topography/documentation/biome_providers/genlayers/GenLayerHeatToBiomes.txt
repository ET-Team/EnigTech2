A more configurable version of GenLayerBiomeDC. Replaces the heat map with a pseudo-random 
weighted biome map. For the vanilla heat map, normally 1 is desert, 2 is warm, 3 
is cool, 4 is icy.



Constructor:
    Arguments:
        long, GenLayer
    Argument Usage:
        base layer seed, parent
    Notes:
        Constructs the layer with the seed and parent.

setSpecialVariantBiome:
    Arguments:
        Non_Null_Biome_ID, Non_Null_Biome_ID
    Usage:
        heat ID, biome ID
    Notes:
        Sets the special variant biome for the provided heat id. What heat ids are available depends on the GenLayer used before this.

setSpecialVariantChance:
    Arguments:
        int
    Usage:
        chance
    Notes:
        Sets the global chance for the special variant biome to be used. This will set the chance for all heat ids. Set this before you set specific ones or it will overwrite. The chance is 1 in the provided number.

setSpecialVariantChance:
    Arguments:
        Non_Null_Biome_ID, int
    Usage:
        heat ID, chance
    Notes:
        Sets the chance for the special variant biome to be used for the provided heat id. The chance is 1 in the provided number. What heat ids are available depends on the GenLayer used before this.

addBiome:
    Arguments:
        Non_Null_Biome_ID, Non_Null_Biome_ID, int
    Usage:
        heat ID, biome ID, weight
    Notes:
        Adds the provided biome id to the provided heat id with the provided weight. What heat ids are available depends on the GenLayer used before this.

addBiome:
    Arguments:
        Non_Null_Biome_ID, Non_Null_Biome_ID
    Usage:
        heat ID, biome ID
    Notes:
        Adds the provided biome id to the provided heat id with a weight of 1. What heat ids are available depends on the GenLayer used before this

setSpecialBiome:
    Arguments:
        Non_Null_Biome_ID, Non_Null_Biome_ID
    Usage:
        heat ID, biome ID
    Notes:
        Sets the special biome for the provided heat id. What heat ids are available depends on the GenLayer used before this.
