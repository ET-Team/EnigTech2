This file is for the options in dimension script files. These are the files referenced 
when registering dimensions in the Topography.txt file. These files can be placed 
anywhere in the config/topography folder, and must end in '.txt'.



useWorldTypeTerrain:
    Notes:
        Sets the dimension to use the ChunkGenerator from the WorldType. This handles all terrain/feature/decoration generation, and Topography features that do the same will not be useable.

generateMineshaft:
    Notes:
        Adds mineshafts to the dimension.

useWorldTypeBiomes:
    Notes:
        Sets the dimension to use the BiomeProvider from the WorldType. This handles all biome mapping, and Topography features that do the same will not be useable.

enableEnviromentalFog:
    Notes:
        Enables enviromental fog. This is the short distance spherical fog used in the nether in vanilla.

setLightBrightnessTable:
    Arguments:
        float array
    Usage:
        brightness table
    Notes:
        Sets an array used for how bright light appears in the dimension. Does not effect the actual light level, just how bright that light appers in the rendering. This array must have 16 values between 0 and 1. In vanilla this is used in the nether to increase the brightness of low light values, making the dimension not as dark while also hiding the large number of lighting errors. The array used for the nether is [0.1, 0.11578947, 0.13333333, 0.15294117, 0.175, 0.20000002, 0.22857141, 0.26153848, 0.3, 0.34545457, 0.4, 0.46666667, 0.5500001, 0.6571429, 0.79999995, 1.0]

enableRelightChecks:
    Notes:
        Enables a very large number of relight checks to be done on each chunk after generation is complete, spread out over a small number of ticks. This causes a very large amount of lag, but is required in dimensions like a lava based nether in order to get the lava to actually emit light.

overrideWeatherRenderer:
    Notes:
        Adds a custom WeatherRenderer for the dimension, and returns it.

setCelestialAngle:
    Arguments:
        float
    Usage:
        celestial angle
    Notes:
        Sets a static celestial angle for the dimension. Useful for forcing it to always be day or not.

setBiomeProviderScript:
    Arguments:
        String
    Usage:
        script path
    Notes:
        Sets the script at the provided path to be used to generate the Biome Provider for the dimension.

    Notes:
        Adds strongholds to the dimension.

generateNetherFortress:
    Arguments:
        int, int, int
    Usage:

    Notes:
        Adds nether fortresses to the dimension. Once in every area*area chunk area there is a 1/spawn chance for a nether fortress to spawn, with a random*random area being used for randomly placing the fortress in the total area. Approximate vanilla values are 3, 16, 4.

generateNetherFortress:
    Notes:
        Adds nether fortresses to the dimension with rarity settings approximately the same as vanilla.

setSpawnStructure:
    Arguments:
        String, int
    Usage:
        structure file path, height
    Notes:
        Sets the spawn structure for the dimension, at the provided height. The file path is relative to the config/topography/structures folder and does not use the file extension.

setSpawnStructureSpacing:
    Arguments:
        int
    Usage:

addBiomes:
    Arguments:
        Non_Null_Biome_ID_Array
    Usage:
        biomes to add
    Notes:
        Overrides the default biome mapping, and adds biomes to generate in the dimension with a weight of 10.

vaporizeWater:
    Notes:
        This enables the vanilla nether option to have water/ice evaporate when placed in the dimension.

generateMonument:
    Notes:
        Adds ocean monuments to the dimension.

setSingleBiome:
    Arguments:
        Non_Null_Biome_ID
    Usage:
        biome id
    Notes:
        Sets a single biome for the dimension to be. Supports all types of biome id format.

disableSky:
    Notes:
        Disables all sky rendering in the dimension. No stars, no sun, no moon, just black.

captureTeleports:
    Notes:
        If this dimension has a spawn structure set, then when teleporting to the dimension, this option cancels the dimension change and has Topography transfer the player itself, placing them in the spawn position on the spawn structure.

addFogColor:
    Arguments:
        int
    Usage:
        color
    Notes:
        Adds a fog color to the dimension with an alpha of 1 and full celestial angle bounds.

generateMansion:
    Arguments:
        Generator
    Notes:
        Adds mansions to the dimension, using the supplied Generator to find acceptable spawn locations. It's suggested to use an OverworldGenerator.

generateEndCity:
    Notes:
        Adds end cities to the dimension with 3, 16, 4 rarity settings. It's nearly impossible to compare these settings to vanilla, so these are approximately the same as vanilla nether fortress.
