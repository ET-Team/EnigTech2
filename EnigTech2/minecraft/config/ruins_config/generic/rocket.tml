# all required mods listed must be present; no prohibited mods can be

# likelihood this template will be chosen relative to all others
# e.g., a weight=6 template is chosen 3X as often as one with weight=2

# list of dimensions in which this template may spawn, even if generic
# one or more dimension names, separated by commas (blank = all)

# list of other biomes in which this template may spawn
# biome corresponding to directory is always assumed, listed or not
# generic templates should leave this list empty

# criterion expression specifying types of biome where template spawns
# this is in addition to those explicitly listed as biomesToSpawnIn
# generic templates should leave this list empty

# list of biomes in which this template may not spawn
# takes precedence over biomeTypesToSpawnIn, but NOT biomesToSpawnIn
# should be empty if biomeTypesToSpawnIn is empty
